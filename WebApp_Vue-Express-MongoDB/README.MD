# WebApp_Vue-Express-MongoBD

This project is the second part of the Computer Science third-year course on Mobile-Based App development, where we combine Vue.js with Express.js and MongoDB to build a robust and scalable mobile-based web application.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage the power of Vue.js for the front-end development, Express.js for the server-side logic, and MongoDB for the database management. The goal is to create a feature-rich web application with seamless user experience and data storage.

## Features

- Integration of Vue.js with Express.js and MongoDB for full-stack web application development.
- Building RESTful APIs for handling user interactions and data retrieval.
- Implementation of user authentication and authorization for secure access.
